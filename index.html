            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
         <p>Hello, I am currently a Junior here at the University of South Carolina. In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, playing golf, and reading about all things related to the human body. I also enjoy traveling and have been to 42 of the 50 States in America. I love to eat at various restaurants and Jack Brown's in Five Points is my favorite restaurant in the Columbia area.<span id="dots">..</span><span id="more"> 
         
         <br>My family as picture above consists of my mother (Lynn), father (Rowland), older sister (Caitlynn), and dog (Cassie). I grew up and attended high school in Maryland where I was very active on both the Varsity Golf and Varsity Lacrosse teams. After high school, I moved to Conway, SC where I enrolled and attended Horry Georgetown Technical College for 2 years and received an Associate Degree in Science.</span></p>

        <h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
            
         <p>My overall goal is to become a Dentist or Oral Surgeon. After completing Dental School I plan to work as an Associate in order to gain experience and knowledge. In the end, I want to open my own practice and have a traveling dental unit where I can provide free treatment to underserved communities and economically challenged people. People who can&#39;t afford much tend to neglect their health and it should not have to be this way. Providing a free service to others that can sometimes be very pricey will benefit their overall well-being and remove some financial burden of taking care of themselves.<span id="dots-2">..</span><span id="more-2"> 
        
        <br>There is an abundance of things that have driven me to pursue dentistry. Another important reason is that it is a profession in which I will be able to serve others and improve their quality of life. To me, there is no better feeling than helping someone else and witnessing the positive effects that come along with it. A third reason I have chosen to pursue dentistry is my grandmother. My grandmother was a dental hygienist, and she is who I get a lot of my inspiration from. She passed away about 5 years ago from Alzheimer&#39;s disease and breast cancer. It was very difficult to witness my caring and joyful grandmother, who was always smiling, suffer from those terrible diseases. Experiencing this has influenced my career goal of becoming a dentist as I know I want to help people as my grandmother did.</span></p>
